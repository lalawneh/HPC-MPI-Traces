# HPC-MPI-Traces
The techniques are implemented using Java. 
- Use the CommPattern-MPITraceSetup.zip to extract the traces from the otf2 files:
  - You need to create the input, processes, step1, step2, and step3 folders.
- Use the CommPatternRecognition.zip to run the trace abstraction techniques.
  - create the output folder in the trace file path. Inside the output folder, create the patterns and commpatterns folders
